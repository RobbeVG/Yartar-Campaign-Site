# [Psionic Ashenwight](3.Mechanics/bestiary/undead/psionic-ashenwight-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 204*  

When an ashenwight arises near a crystal vein infused with aberrant power, or when one lingers in an area of fell magic, there is a chance for the ashenwight to develop psionic abilities. A psionic ashenwight is markedly more sapient than other ashenwights, though the resulting consciousness is a new creation separate from who the ashenwight was in life.

Some psionic ashenwights dedicate their existence to piecing together their previous life, while others strive to enlighten other ashenwights to this new psionic power.

## Ashenwights

When a Humanoid consumed by cruelty and rage dies in an area corrupted by the Far Realm, the creature sometimes rises as an ashenwight. The skin of these Undead horrors is desiccated, and their eyes often glow with otherworldly power.
