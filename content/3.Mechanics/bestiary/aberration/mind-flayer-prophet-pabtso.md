# [Mind Flayer Prophet](3.Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer-prophet-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 210*

Mind flayers, also known as illithids, feast on the brains of Humanoids across the multiverse. They are distinguished by their purple-toned skin and octopus-like heads, from which extend writhing tentacles.
