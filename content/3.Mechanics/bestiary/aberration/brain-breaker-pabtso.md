Brain breakers look like giant brains with stout legs, and they wear steel armor made from interlocked links of Ilvaash's runes (knots of tentacles, brains, and jagged lines reminiscent of jaws).

      \ that something is linked to its mind once it no longer has the [incapacitated](3.Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ condition, and the brain breaker can terminate the link at any time (no action\
      \ required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the\
      \ link, doing so with a successful DC 17 Charisma check. If the target breaks\
      \ the link this way, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The link also\
      \ ends if the target and the brain breaker are more than 1 mile apart. The brain\
      \ breaker can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time."
