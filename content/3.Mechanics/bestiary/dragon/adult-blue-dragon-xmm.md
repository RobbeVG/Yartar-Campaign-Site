# Adult Blue Dragon

Adult blue dragons command small empires, which might be territories of subjugated followers, shadowy criminal networks, or cultic enclaves. Endlessly suspicious and wary of rivals, these dragons enact elaborate schemes to ruin their foes, test the loyalty of their servants, and ensure their dominance for centuries.

## Blue Dragons

*Dragons of Tyranny and Tempests*

- **Habitat.** Desert  
- **Treasure.** [Relics](3.Mechanics/tables/random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave control and collect followers like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations.

Blue dragons have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.

Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.

### Blue Dragon Lairs

Blue dragons dwell in arid lands. Their lairs might be death traps meant to entomb invaders or ostentatious fortresses where they plot domination.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting to cast [Shatter](3.Mechanics/spells/shatter-xphb.md).

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+12|noform|noparens|text(+12)`, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+7|noform|noparens|avg|text(16)` (`2d8 + 7`) Slashing damage plus `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) Lightning damage.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 19, each creature in a 90-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [Line](3.Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md). *Failure:* `dice:11d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(60)` (`11d10`) Lightning damage. *Success:* Half damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The dragon casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will:** [Detect Magic](3.Mechanics/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md), [Invisibility](3.Mechanics/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Mage Hand](3.Mechanics/spells/mage-hand-xphb.md), [Shatter](3.Mechanics/spells/shatter-xphb.md)

**1/day each:** [Scrying](3.Mechanics/spells/scrying-xphb.md), [Sending](3.Mechanics/spells/sending-xphb.md)

## Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature's turn, the dragon can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The dragon regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

***Cloaked Flight.*** The dragon uses Spellcasting to cast [Invisibility](3.Mechanics/spells/invisibility-xphb.md) on itself, and it can fly up to half its [Fly Speed](3.Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md). The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Sonic Boom.*** The dragon uses Spellcasting to cast [Shatter](3.Mechanics/spells/shatter-xphb.md). The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Tail Swipe.*** The dragon makes one Rend attack.

## Regional Effects

The region containing an adult or ancient blue dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sinkholes.** Sinkholes form more frequently in the area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature in that area other than the dragon and its allies finishes a [Long Rest](3.Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), roll `dice:1d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d20`). On a 1, a sinkhole opens beneath the creature, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `2d4 × 10` feet into the sinkhole.  
- **Spiteful Storms.** Dust devils and thunderstorms rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is [Lightly Obscured](3.Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md).  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
