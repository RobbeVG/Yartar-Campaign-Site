# [Owlbear](3.Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 234. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Owlbears are tenacious hunters that might track prey over miles and rarely give up their hunts.

## Owlbears

*Magically Perfected Predators*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Created long ago by misguided mages, owlbears combine keen avian eyes, thick feathers, and a tearing beak with a mighty bearlike frame. Despite their magical origins, owlbears have propagated and spread to wildernesses across the multiverse.

Owlbears dwell in distinctive dens. Roll on or choose a result from the Owlbear Den Features table to inspire an owlbear den's noteworthy traits.

**Owlbear Den Features**
