## Jackalwere

*Shape-Shifting Trickster of the Wilds*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** [Implements](3.Mechanics/tables/random-magic-items-implements.md)  

Indistinguishable from jackals in their natural form, jackalweres shape-shift to deceive others. These shape-shifters can take three forms: a jackal, a human, or a monstrous hybrid of the two. Jackalweres are easily mistaken for werewolves, but jackalweres aren't supernaturally afflicted—their jackal forms are their natural state. Jackalweres also possess magical gazes capable of putting foes to sleep, allowing jackalweres to play their tricks unimpeded or get the upper hand over threats.

Jackalweres dwell in inhospitable wildernesses and pride themselves on their cleverness. They take offense at those who travel through their lands without leaving a gift of treasure or fresh game. Roll on or choose a result from the Jackalwere Tricks table to inspire how a jackalwere repays such slights.

## Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** The jackalwere has [Advantage](3.Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the jackalwere's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [Incapacitated](3.Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The jackalwere makes two Rend or Slam attacks.

***Rend (Jackal or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|noparens|text(+4)`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) Piercing damage.

***Slam (Human or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|noparens|text(+4)`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+2|noform|noparens|avg|text(4)` (`1d4 + 2`) Bludgeoning damage.

***Sleep Gaze (Recharge 5-6).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 10, one creature the jackalwere can see within 30 feet (Constructs and Undead succeed automatically). *Failure:* The target has the [Unconscious](3.Mechanics/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition for 10 minutes or until it takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it. *Success:* The target is immune to this jackalwere's Sleep Gaze for 24 hours.

## Bonus Actions

***Shape-Shift.*** The jackalwere shape-shifts into a Medium human or a Medium jackal-humanoid hybrid, or it returns to its true form (that of a Small jackal). Other than its size, its game statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
